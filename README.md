# Bootcamp Project Monorepo

Disclaimer: This was made for a 5 week bootcamp under the Software Engineering Academy, it is in no way a Sky product

The .git folder for each project is included but renamed to .git_[project] inside the individual project directories. If you want to see the git logs for whatever reason just rename them back to .git

If you just need a containerised app that you can deploy to places, check out `/web-containerised`
